    content: 'Steam in the bathroom should not usually get too hot for your pet, since he/she should only be in the room for approximately 10 minutes. However, if the weather is very warm or if your pet is intolerant to heat (notably some short-nosed breeds like bulldogs or Boston terriers, or with overweight dogs or cats), then heat intolerance is a concern. Good judgment dictates that you should watch for signs of heat intolerance (excessive panting in a dog, any panting in a cat, lethargy, or sluggishness) and take your pet’s temperature if uncertain—it should never go above 104°F (40°C). If heat intolerance or overheating/hyperthermia seem to be present, discontinue the steam sessions or try again later with lower heat and less steam.'

    content: 'As a general rule, it is not advised to breathe in the vapors from the nebulizer if medication has been added to the nebulization cup, because then you will be taking the pet’s medication yourself. The short duration of exposure for medicated nebulizations (8 to 10 breaths) and performing the treatments in an area with good ventilation  mean that your exposure to the medication, while not zero, should be negligible.'
